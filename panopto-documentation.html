      Introduction to Panopto Video
    </h2>
    <p>
      Panopto can be used as a video capturing, editing, hosting & streaming platform. 
      Due to privacy constraints, SFU Canvas integration with Panopto is restricted to 
      access to Panopto tools through the left side navigation in your Canvas course.
    </p>

    <p>
      After recording/uploading a video in Panopto, students can view the videos directly 
      in Panopto Video in your Canvas course. Panopto also allows students to create & 
      submit videos as an assignment.
